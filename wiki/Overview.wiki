#summary Lepton -- Architecture Overview

= Architecture Overview =

This should give you a basic overview of the terminology and top-level constructs of the Lepton particle engine.

== Groups ==

ParticleGroup objects are the lowest level construct. Groups consist of an arbitrary number of particle. Although in many ways a group is like a particle container, particles cannot exist independently outside of a group. All particles are created and destroyed via their group's methods. A particle spends its entire existence within a single group.

Groups may be iterated to access individual particles. The objects returned through iteration are ParticleProxy objects that serve as a convenient way to manipulate individual particles within the group. Utimately, however, particle proxies are not independent first-class objects.

== Controllers ==
