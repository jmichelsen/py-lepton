#summary Lepton -- Architecture Overview

= Architecture Overview =

This should give you a basic overview of the terminology and top-level constructs of the Lepton particle engine.

== Groups ==

ParticleGroup objects are the lowest level construct. Groups consist of an arbitrary number of [Particle]s. Although in many ways a group is like a particle container, particles cannot exist independently outside of a group. All particles are created and destroyed via their group's methods. A particle spends its entire existence within a single group.

Groups may be iterated to access individual particles. The objects returned through iteration are ParticleProxy objects that serve as a convenient way to manipulate individual particles within the group. Utimately, however, particle proxies are not independent first-class objects.

All particles in a group have the same general behavior and are rendered together using the same renderer.

== Controllers ==

ParticleController objects control the behavior of particles in a group. Typically, particle controllers are bound to a particular ParticleGroup or ParticleSystem. The controller modifies the particles in the group -- or all the groups in the system -- it is bound to at each update iteration. An update iteration is typically scheduled at a regular interval, or can simply done for each animation frame. 

Several controller types are included in Lepton, and it is easy to create your own as well. Some commonly used controllers are:

  * LifetimeController -- Kills particles older than a specified age.
  * GravityController -- Imparts a fixed acceleration to all particles in a group
  * MovementController -- Updates the position of particles based on their velocity.
  * ColorBlenderController -- Modulates the color of particles over time.
  * FaderController -- Fades the alpha component of particles in and out over time.
  * CollectorController -- Kills particles as the enter or exit a [Domain].
  * BounceController -- Deflects particles off the surface of a [Domain].

Controllers are a major focus of Lepton's development and more will be added over time.
