=== Other Particle Systems ===

http://particlesystems.org
    An open source particle engine and API written in C++. A strong source or ideas and inspiration. Lepton [Domain]s in particular are inspired by this project.

[http://jops.softmed.org/ Java Open Particle System]
  An open source particle engine for Java. Has a nice GUI for creating particle effect.s

http://www.wondertouch.com/
  A very nice looking commercial particle engine. Nice examples to draw inspiration from.

=== Papers ===

[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20000623/vanderburg_01.htm Building an advanced particle system]
  Gamasutra article with some ideas, not sure how "advanced" they are, but they are good basics.

[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3680/a_more_accurate_volumetric_.php More accurate volumetric particle renderering]
  Talks about solving boundary artifacts when volume filling particles (e.g., smoke) contact solid surfaces in 3D scenes. Something to consider for future Lepton functionality.

[http://ati.amd.com/developer/techreports/2004/GH2004/Kipfer-UberFlow%20A%20GPU-Based%20Particle%20Engine(GH04)-Slides.pdf GPU-based particle system]
  Particle system implemented using shaders. Contains some valuable ideas and datastructures for any particle system, however.

[http://2ld.de/gdc2007/EverythingAboutParticleEffectsSlides.pdf Particle effects presentation]

[http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20040728/latta_01.shtml Building a million-particle system] 
  Some ideas on scaling up particle effects, mostly involving pushing the work off to the GPU.
