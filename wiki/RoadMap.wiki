#summary Features and changes that are planned for future versions

=== Shorter Term (Probably in 1.0) ===

*Dynamic parameters* -- [ParticleController]s and possibly other components would support dynamic parameters that can change over time, either via a step function, linear interpolator or spline.

*Improved domains* -- native code domains with support for more shapes, such as cones, cylinders, toroids, heightmaps and tri-meshes.
