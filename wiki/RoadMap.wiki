#summary Features and changes that are planned for future versions

=== Shorter Term (Probably in 1.0) ===

*Dynamic parameters* -- [ParticleController]s and possibly other components would support dynamic parameters that can change over time, either via a step function, linear interpolator or spline.

*Improved domains* -- native code [Domain]s with support for more shapes, such as cones, cylinders, toroids, heightmaps and tri-meshes.

*Texturizers* -- Built-in support for texture atlases, texture coordinate generation, texture animation and 3D textures.

*Windows Binary* 

=== Longer Term (post 1.0) ===

*Particle-Particle Collision* -- For collective and liquid effects.

*String and Cloth Simulation* -- Special particle groups/collectors for simulation of cloth, fibers, etc.
